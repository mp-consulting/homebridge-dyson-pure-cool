# Workflow: Course Correction

**Agent:** Scrum Master
**Shortcut:** `*correct-course` or `CC`
**Phase:** 4 - Implementation

## Purpose

Handle mid-sprint scope changes, blockers, or significant issues that require adjusting the plan.

## When to Use
- New requirements discovered
- Technical blocker encountered
- Scope needs adjustment
- Priorities have shifted
- External dependency changed

## Course Correction Process

### 1. Assess the Situation
- [ ] Understand the change/issue
- [ ] Determine urgency
- [ ] Identify affected stories
- [ ] Estimate impact

### 2. Impact Analysis

| Area | Impact | Severity |
|------|--------|----------|
| Current sprint | | Low/Med/High |
| Future sprints | | Low/Med/High |
| Architecture | | Low/Med/High |
| Timeline | | Low/Med/High |

### 3. Options Evaluation

#### Option A: Absorb Change
- Add to current sprint
- De-scope other items if needed
- Minimal planning disruption

#### Option B: Defer Change
- Add to backlog
- Prioritize for next sprint
- Document for future

#### Option C: Pivot
- Significant scope change
- May require re-planning
- Stakeholder discussion needed

### 4. Decision

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|--------------|
| Urgency | How urgent is the change? |
| Impact | What's affected if we don't change? |
| Effort | How much work is involved? |
| Risk | What are the risks of each option? |

### 5. Update Artifacts
Based on decision:
- [ ] Update sprint status
- [ ] Modify affected stories
- [ ] Update backlog priorities
- [ ] Document the change
